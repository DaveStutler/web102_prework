## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
One of the toughtest things that I ran into was thinking about how to redesign this website to look original as much as possible. Given little infomation about the page, I went with the most basic design that I can think of, with bigger fonts and better spacing between each sections. Also, some instructions were confusing when I first read them. I ran into an error when I was testing the destructuring features. If it is required, please let me know and I will definitely redo that part.
